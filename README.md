This is the discription!
When I was 13 I moved to Newark, Delaware with my mother and twin brother and where I would attend Geroge V. Kirk middle school and Christiana High School. I would then go onto attend Delaware State University where I would declare as an engineering major and CS minor. In my free time I like to workout, watch YouTube, play video games and watch basketball.
